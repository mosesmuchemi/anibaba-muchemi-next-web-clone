# Project: Building with Responsive Design

In this collaborative project, we were to build a responsive website. Weâ€™ll be cloning  [The Next Web](https://thenextweb.com/), a tech-focused magazine which uses media queries to gracefully degrade their site as the window size is reduced. 

This is the 5th collaborative project of the Main HTML/CSS curriculum at [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/) - @microverseinc

* The project was completed using html and css
